## 1.3.0 (2023-06-01)

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/administrator/upgrade/index.html

Update instructions:

- If you are running the docker deployment, make sure to update our compose file.
  In this small example we show you how to save the old config and update it
  correctly:

  ```
  export FUNKWHALE_VERSION="1.3.0"
  cd /srv/funkwhale
  docker-compose down
  mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.bak
  curl -L -o /srv/funkwhale/docker-compose.yml "https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/raw/${FUNKWHALE_VERSION}/deploy/docker-compose.yml"
  ```

  :::{note}
  If you need to customize your nginx template, e.g. to work around [problems with Docker's resolver](https://docs.funkwhale.audio/admin/external-storages.html#no-resolver-found), you can mount your
  custom nginx configuration into the container. Uncomment the commented volumes in the `nginx` section of your `docker-compose.yml`.
  Additionally you need to update the paths in `nginx/funkwhale.template`.
  Replace all occurrences of `/funkwhale` by `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
  This loads the templates from your `nginx` folder and overrides the template files in the Docker container.
  :::

  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- The Docker instructions now use the updated Docker compose plugin. If you previously used the `docker-compose` standalone installation, do the following while upgrading:

  1. Download the [Docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository)
  2. Stop your containers using the **docker-compose** syntax.

  ```sh
  sudo docker-compose down
  ```

  3. Bring the containers back up using the **docker compose** syntax.

  ```sh
  sudo docker compose up -d
  ```

  After this you can continue to use the **docker compose** syntax for all Docker management tasks.

- Upgrade Postgres to version 15. [Make sure to migrate!](https://docs.funkwhale.audio/administrator/upgrade/docker.html#upgrade-the-postgres-container)
- With this update Funkwhale starts using poetry to maintain its dependencies. We therefore recommend
  removing the old virtualenv by running `rm -rf /srv/funkwhale/virtualenv`.

## 1.2.0 (2021-12-27)

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/administrator/upgrade/index.html

Due to a bug in our CI Pipeline, you need to download the frontend artifact here: https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/-/jobs/81069/artifacts/download

If you are running the All-in-One-Container since a longer time, you probably need to manually migrate your database information. If that's the case, you will get a message like this:

`DETAIL: The data directory was initialized by PostgreSQL version 11, which is not compatible with this version 13.5.`

Make sure the Funkwhale version is set to `1.1.4` in `docker-compose.yml`. Now you can run this command to dump the database into a file:

`docker-compose exec -T funkwhale pg_dump -c -U funkwhale > "db.dump"`

Now you can update the Funkwhale version in `docker-compose.yml` to `1.2.0`. Additionally you should save your `data` directory, eg by running `mv data data.bak && mkdir data`. Stop Funkwhale and start it again with the new version, by using `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`. This will initialize a fresh DB and applies all migrations. Now you can restore your database with the following command: `cat db.dump | docker-compose exec -T funkwhale psql -U funkwhale`. That's it, enjoy!

## 1.0 (2020-09-09)

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/administrator/upgrade/index.html

### Dropped python 3.5 support [manual action required, non-docker only]

With Funkwhale 1.0, we're dropping support for Python 3.5. Before upgrading,
ensure `python3 --version` returns `3.6` or higher.

If it returns `3.6` or higher, you have nothing to do.

If it returns `3.5`, you will need to upgrade your Python version/Host, then recreate your virtual environment:

```sh
rm -rf /srv/funkwhale/virtualenv
python3 -m venv /srv/funkwhale/virtualenv
```

### Increased quality of JPEG thumbnails [manual action required]

Default quality for JPEG thumbnails was increased from 70 to 95, as 70 was producing visible artifacts in resized images.

Because of this change, existing thumbnails will not load, and you will need to:

1. delete the `__sized__` directory in your `MEDIA_ROOT` directory
2. run `python manage.py fw media generate-thumbnails` to regenerate thumbnails with the enhanced quality

If you don't want to regenerate thumbnails, you can keep the old ones by adding `THUMBNAIL_JPEG_RESIZE_QUALITY=70` to your .env file.

### Small API breaking change in `/api/v1/libraries`

To allow easier crawling of public libraries on a pod,we had to make a slight breaking change
to the behaviour of `GET /api/v1/libraries`.

Before, it returned only libraries owned by the current user.

Now, it returns all the accessible libraries (including ones from other users and pods).

If you are consuming the API via a third-party client and need to retrieve your libraries,
use the `scope` parameter, like this: `GET /api/v1/libraries?scope=me`

### API breaking change in `/api/v1/albums`

To increase performance, querying `/api/v1/albums` doesn't return album tracks anymore. This caused
some performance issues, especially as some albums and series have dozens or even hundreds of tracks.

If you want to retrieve tracks for an album, you can query `/api/v1/tracks/?album=<albumid>`.

### JWT deprecation

API Authentication using JWT is deprecated and will be removed in Funkwhale 1.0. Please use OAuth or application tokens
and refer to our API documentation at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/swagger/ for guidance.
