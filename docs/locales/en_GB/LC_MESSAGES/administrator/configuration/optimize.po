"Funkwhale uses Celery to handle asynchronous tasks. By default, Celery "

"You can set the number of workers using the `CELERYD_CONCURRENCY` "

"`CELERYD_CONCURRENCY=1` spawns a single worker."

"Celery uses a `prefork` pool by default. This enables the server to "
"process many tasks at the same time. You can switch to a `solo` pool "
"which handles tasks one at a time. This reduces memory overhead but "
"removes the ability to process tasks concurrently."
