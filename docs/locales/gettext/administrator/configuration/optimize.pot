msgid "Funkwhale uses Celery to handle asynchronous tasks. By default, Celery spawns a worker per CPU core. This can lead to higher memory usage."

msgid "You can set the number of workers using the `CELERYD_CONCURRENCY` variable in your `.env` file. For example, a value of `CELERYD_CONCURRENCY=1` spawns a single worker."

#: ../../administrator/configuration/optimize.md:17
msgid "Celery uses a `prefork` pool by default. This enables the server to process many tasks at the same time. You can switch to a `solo` pool which handles tasks one at a time. This reduces memory overhead but removes the ability to process tasks concurrently."
