In order to do this, add ``funkwhale_api.common.middleware.PymallocMiddleware`` to the environment variable ``ADDITIONAL_MODDLEWARES_BEFORE`` This adds a middleware which should not do anything by default. Tracing can be activated by setting ``PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=1`` This might has some inpact on the performance, please report how it goes. The Middleware now prints the top 25 memory allocations to the API logs."
