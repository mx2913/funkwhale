msgid "With some Funkwhale releases, it is recommended to upgrade the version of the Postgres database server container.

When upgrading Postgres, it is not sufficient to change the container referenced in ``docker-compose.yml``. New major versions of Postgres cannot read the databases created by older major versions. The data has to be exported from a running instance of the old version and imported by the new version."
