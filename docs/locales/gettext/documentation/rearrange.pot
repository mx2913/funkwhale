msgid "Running ``make html`` in the ``docs`` directory (assuming you have :doc:`Sphinx installed <tools>`) will generate a series of warnings letting you know if any links are orphaned."

msgid "Once internal document links have been resolved, it is important to consider that the moved file may have also been linked externally elsewhere before. In order to ensure that anybody trying to access the file is properly redirected to its new location, we need to make use of the link redirector in the ``conf.py`` file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../documentation/rearrange.rst:37
msgid "The link redirector takes two arguments: the old location of the file (passed as a .html file at the relative path ``docs``), and the new location it should redirect to. For example, if a document was moved from ``docs/index.html`` to ``docs/admin/index.html``, we would add the following to the ``redirect_files`` section of ``conf.py``:"

#: ../../documentation/rearrange.rst:53
msgid "If you are moving something from one folder to another, you would need to tell the redirect to move to the correct level. For example, if a file is moving from ``docs/admin/index.html`` to ``docs/users/index.html``, you will need to add the following to the ``redirect_files`` section of ``conf.py``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../documentation/rearrange.rst:69
msgid "The script will then take these two arguments and create a redirect file in the original location so that anybody accessing the existing URL will be redirected."
