msgid "Funkwhale's documentation is written using a standard markup language called `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. It is similar to Markdown and other web-based markup languages, but is better suited to technical documentation due to its standardized nature. A full syntax breakdown can be found `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_, but the following should be enough to get you started on writing docs for Funkwhale."
