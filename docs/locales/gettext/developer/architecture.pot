#: ../../developer_documentation/architecture.md:37
msgid "Users can access Funkwhale using a variety of entrypoints. They can make use of a Funkwhale application, a Subsonic-compatible application, or by calling the API directly. Each entrypoint interacts with the Funkwhale backend in the same way."

#: ../../developer_documentation/architecture.md:41
msgid "The Funkwhale web app is a {abbr}`SPA (Single Page Application)` written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org). This is the application most people associate with Funkwhale. Server admins usually run an instance of the web app alongside their Funkwhale {term}`pod`, but you can also connect a standalone web app to another pod."

msgid "Funkwhale has to handle a lot of tasks that take longer than the average HTTP request/response cycle. To ensure these tasks complete and don't impact the API's performance, they are offloaded to a [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/workers.html) task worker.

To manage these, we implement a [Celery beat](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.apps.beat.html#celery.apps.beat.Beat) scheduler. The scheduler is responsible for triggering tasks on a schedule and adding messages to the [queue](#redis-cache-and-message-queue) so the worker can work through them."
