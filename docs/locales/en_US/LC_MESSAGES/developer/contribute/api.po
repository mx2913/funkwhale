"The Funkwhale API is the core of the Funkwhale ecosystem. It powers all "
"actions in the Funkwhale app as well as other apps such as the CLI and "
"mopidy plugin. The API is written in [Django rest framework](https://www"
".django-rest-framework.org/)."

"Before you start work on the API, you should open up a conversation in "
"[the forum](https://forum.funkwhale.audio) to discuss the changes you "
"want to make. All API changes need to be defined and scoped before code "
"changes are made. If you are fixing a bug, you don't need to discuss this"
" in the forum first."
