"Funkwhale uses Celery to handle asynchronous tasks. By default, Celery "
"spawns a worker per CPU core. This can lead to higher memory usage."

"You can set the number of workers using the `CELERYD_CONCURRENCY` "
"variable in your `.env` file. For example, a value of "
"`CELERYD_CONCURRENCY=1` spawns a single worker."

"Reducing the number of celery workers slows down the handling of "
"asynchronous tasks. On larger instances, this can cause performance "
"problems."

msgid ""
"Celery uses a `prefork` pool by default. This enables the server to "
"process many tasks at the same time. You can switch to a `solo` pool "
"which handles tasks one at a time. This reduces memory overhead but "
"removes the ability to process tasks concurrently."
