# Funkwhale plugins

Plugins can be used to extend Funkwhale's featureset without needing to touch the underlying code. Plugins can extend existing features, add support for third-party services, or introduce cosmetic changes to the Funkwhale webapp.

Plugins have been supported since Funkwhale 1.0. Some core plugins, such as the standard Scrobbler plugin, are maintained by the Funkwhale team.
