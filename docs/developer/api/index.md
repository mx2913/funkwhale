# Funkwhale API

The Funkwhale API is a [REST API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). It is the central component of the project and houses the application's logic.

The current API (v1) is **stable**, meaning we are committed to not introducing breaking changes and to maintaining compatibility. We are currently working on Funkwhale API v2, but this is a work in progress and not yet ready for production use.
