# Allow-listing

By default, Funkwhale communicates with all reachable pods on the {term}`Fediverse`. If you want to lock down which pods you interact with, your pod admin can enable **allow-listing**. With this enabled, only pods on your allow-list can interact with your pod.

If you didn't use allow-listing before, you can remove all content from pods not on your list. Check out our guide on [purging content](../domains/purge.md) to remove this content.
