# User

In Funkwhale, a **User** represents a **person** who uses the Funkwhale software.

When a person signs up to a Funkwhale server, they create a user profile. This user profile is associated with all of that person's activities, such as:

- Uploading content
- Listening to content
- Favoriting content
- Editing metadata
- Reporting issues

## Web app behavior

Funkwhale shows users a **Profile** which contains the information they have shared on the platform, including a summary of their activities and their content. Users may update this profile information at any time.

Users may follow other users by navigating to their profile and sending a follow request. Following another user displays their shared activity on their profile as well as in activity streams on Funkwhale, such as the "Recently listened" and "Recently favorited" streams.

## Federation behavior

Funkwhale users are represented by [ActivityPub `Actor` objects][actor].
