Identifying Gaps in Funkwhale Documentation
===========================================

As Funkwhale and its community continue to grow and develop, more and more processes and features
will need to be documented. As users find interesting new ways to interact with the software,
provide novel solutions to existing issues, and find information they need missing, the documents
will need to be updated and added to.

If you are trying to do something in Funkwhale and can't find any
resources to help, you can help out by contributing in one of the following ways:

Providing Documentation
-----------------------

If you've identified a gap or mistake in the documentation and feel comfortable writing up new
guides/correcting existing ones, please feel free to do so. The best way to do this is by following
the :doc:`document creation guide <creating>` to make sure your documents get processed as quickly
as possible.

Requesting Documentation
------------------------

If you're not comfortable with writing documents or don't feel like you can, you can help out
by requesting a document be written. There are three ways to request new documents:

- Open a new issue on `Gitlab <https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/issues>`_, providing as much detail as possible
- Start a new thread on `the forum <https://forum.funkwhale.audio/>`_ with more details about your requests
- Ask somebody on our `chat room <https://matrix.to/#/#funkwhale:matrix.org>`_
