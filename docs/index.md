# Welcome to Funkwhale's documentation

Funkwhale is a self-hosted audio player and publication platform. It enables users to build libraries of existing content and publish their own.

Funkwhale uses the [ActivityPub protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) to talk to other apps across the {term}`Fediverse`. Users can share content between {term}`Funkwhale pods <Pod>` or with other Fediverse software.
