- __Play next__ – add the selected track to the next position in the queue.
- __Play now__ – play the selected track immediately but do not clear the queue.

To add a track to the queue:

1. Find your track in a track table.
2. Select the orange play button ({fa}`play`) to __Play__ the track. Select the kebab menu ({fa}`ellipsis-v`) to select a different __Play option__.

That's it! You've added the track to your queue.
