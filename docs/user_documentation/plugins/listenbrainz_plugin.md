# ListenBrainz plugin

The __ListenBrainz__ plugin enables you to submit (scrobble) listens to your [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org) account. Scrobbling listens helps you build up a profile of your music tastes. It also enables you to keep a record of your listens.

7. Toggle the __Enabled__ switch.
8. Enter __Your ListenBrainz user token__. You can find this on your ListenBrainz profile.
9. Select __Save__.

That's it! You've set up the __ListenBrainz__ plugin. When you listen to tracks, the plugin sends the information to ListenBrainz.
