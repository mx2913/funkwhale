# Maloja plugin

The __Maloja__ plugin enables you to submit (scrobble) listens to your Maloja server. [Maloja](https://github.com/krateng/maloja) is a self-hosted scrobbling service similar to [Last.fm](https://last.fm) and [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org). Check out [their documentation](https://github.com/krateng/maloja#how-to-install) to set up your own server.

Scrobbling listens helps you build up a profile of your music tastes. It also enables you to keep a record of your listens.
