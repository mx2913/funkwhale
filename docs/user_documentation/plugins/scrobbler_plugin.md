# Scrobbler plugin

```{note}
If you want to use [Last.fm](https://last.fm) to scrobble your listens, your pod admin needs to set up an API account. Contact your {term}`pod` admin if you have any questions.
```

The __Scrobbler__ plugin enables you to submit ({term}`scrobble<Scrobbling>`) listens to a scrobbler service. Scrobbling listens helps you build up a profile of your music tastes. It also enables you to keep a record of your listens.
