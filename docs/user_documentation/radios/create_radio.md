# Create a radio

```{note}
If you add content from a __private__ library to a __public__ radio, users can see the tracks but can't play them.
```

Create a new radio to create a dynamic playlist of content based on filters. You can filter tracks by __Artist__ and __Tag__.

3. Enter a {guilabel}`Radio name`.
4. __Optional__ – enter a {guilabel}`Description` for your radio.
5. To make your radio available to other users on your {term}`pod`, enable the {guilabel}`Display publicly` switch. If you disable this switch, only you can see the radio.
6. Select {guilabel}`Artist` or {guilabel}`Tag` from the {guilabel}`Select a filter` dropdown.
7. Select {guilabel}`Add filter` to add the filter to your radio.
8. Configure your filter:
