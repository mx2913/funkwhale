# Radios

Radios are a great way to discover new music or rediscover old favorites. A radio builds a dynamic playlist of content based on selected criteria. Create genre and artist radios, or tune in to one of Funkwhale's built-in radios.

Funkwhale offers the following radios out of the box:

- __Your content__ – listen to content from [libraries](../libraries/index.md) you own.
- __Favorites__ – listen to tracks from your [favorites](../favorites/index.md) list.
- __Random__ – discover something new by letting Funkwhale choose tracks at random.
- __Recently Added__ – listen to the latest content added to your {term}`pod`.
- __Less listened__ – check out tracks you've not heard, or things you haven't given as much attention.
