# Remove your avatar

If you don't want to have an avatar any more, you can remove it. To do this:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Sour your avatar to expand the user menu.
3. Select __Settings__.

That's it! You've removed your avatar from your account. Other users will only see the initials of your username when they visit your profile.
