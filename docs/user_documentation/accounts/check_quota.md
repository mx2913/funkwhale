# Check your upload quota

Your pod admin can assign users an __upload quota__. This is the amount of storage you have access to. Pod admins can assign a default quota to all users. They can also increase or decrease quotas for individual users. Your upload quota applies to content in [libraries](../libraries/index.md) and [channels](../channels/index.md).

If you run out of space, you can contact your pod admin to request more.

To check your upload quota:

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select the upload icon ({fa}`upload`) in the top of the sidebar.
3. Select {guilabel}`Get started` under {guilabel}`Upload third-party content in a library`.
4. A screen appears showing your upload quota and your libraries.
5. The {guilabel}`Current usage` section shows you how much of your quota you are using.
