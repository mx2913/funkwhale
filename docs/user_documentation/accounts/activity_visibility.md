# Change your activity visibility

Your __activity visibility__ determines who can see your listening activity on Funkwhale. There are three visibility options:

- __Nobody except me__ – only you can see your listening activity.
- __Everyone on this instance__ – users who have an account on the same {term}`pod` as you can see your listening activity.
- __Everyone, across all instances__ – anybody can see your listening activity.

To change your activity visibility:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select the cog icon ({fa}`cog`) or your avatar to expand the user menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Settings`.
4. Find {guilabel}`Activity visibility` in the {guilabel}`Account settings` section.
5. Select your visibility level from the dropdown menu.
6. Select {guilabel}`Update settings` to save your changes.

```

```{tabbed} Mobile

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select the cog icon ({fa}`cog`) or your avatar to open the {guilabel}`Options` menu.

4. Find {guilabel}`Activity visibility` in the {guilabel}`Account settings` section.
5. Select your visibility level from the dropdown menu.
6. Select {guilabel}`Update settings` to save your changes.

That's it! You've updated your activity visibility. This change takes effect as soon as you update your settings.
