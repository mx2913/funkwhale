# Change your password

```{warning}
Changing your account password also changes your Subsonic API password. If you are using a Subsonic app, you need to update your password in the app as well.
```

You can update your account password whenever you need to. To do this:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select the cog icon or your avatar to expand the user menu.
3. Select __Settings__.
4. Scroll to the __Change my password__ section.
5. Enter your __Current password__.
6. Enter your __New password__.
7. Select __Change password__.

That's it! Your password is reset. You need to use your new password to log in from now on.
