To use Funkwhale, you need to create an account on a Funkwhale pod. Signing up to a pod requires the following information:

- A valid email address. Administrators can use this to verify you are not a bot.
- A username.
- A password.

## Check a pod's policies

Before you sign up to a pod, you should check its __policies__. You can find these by navigating to the pod's __About this pod__ page.

1. Navigate to the pod.
2. Select the __About this pod__ link in the sidebar.
3. Select the __Learn more__ button in the __About this pod__ section.

Administrators can add a pod's __Rules__ and __Terms and privacy policy__ to this page. Make sure to read through them before signing up. For more information, check out our guide to the About this pod page.

## Sign up

Once you've found an instance you like the look of, you can create your account.

1. Select the __Create an account__ button in the sidebar.
2. Enter the __Username__ you have chosen.
3. Enter your __Email__ address.
4. Enter your __Password__.
5. Pod administrators can add extra requirements for new accounts. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.
6. Select __Create my account__.
7. Pod administrators may require you to verify your email address before you can use your account. Check your email for more instructions.

## Log in

When you've created and activated your account, you can log in.

1. Select the __Login__ button in the sidebar.
2. Enter your __username__ or __email address__.
3. Enter your __Password__.
4. Select __Login__.
