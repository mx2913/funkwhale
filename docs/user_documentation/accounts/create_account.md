# Create your Funkwhale account

```{tip}
Use our [Pod Picker tool](https://network.funkwhale.audio/dashboards/d/overview/network-overview) to find the perfect pod for you!
```

To use Funkwhale, you need to create an account on a {term}`Funkwhale pod <Pod>`. Signing up to a pod requires the following information:

- A valid email address. Administrators can use this to verify you are not a bot.
- A username.
- A password.

## Check your pod's policies

Before you sign up to a pod, you should check its __policies__. You can find these by navigating to the pod's {guilabel}`About this pod` page.

1. Navigate to the pod.
2. Select the {guilabel}`About this pod` link in the sidebar.
3. Select the {guilabel}`Learn more` button in the {guilabel}`About this pod` section.

Administrators can add a pod's {guilabel}`Rules` and {guilabel}`Terms and privacy policy` to this page. Make sure to read through them before signing up. Also check the {guilabel}`Upload quota` to see how much space users have access to.

## Sign up

Once you've found an instance you like the look of, you can create your account.

1. Select the {guilabel}`Create an account` button in the sidebar.
2. Enter the {guilabel}`Username` you have chosen.
3. Enter your {guilabel}`Email` address.
4. Enter your {guilabel}`Password`.
5. Pod administrators can add extra requirements for new accounts. Fields marked with an asterisk ({guilabel}`*`) are required.
6. Select {guilabel}`Create my account`.
7. Pod administrators may require you to verify your email address before you can use your account. Check your email for more instructions.

## Log in

When you've created and activated your account, you can log in.

1. Select the {guilabel}`Login` button in the sidebar.
2. Enter your {guilabel}`Username or e-mail address`.
3. Enter your {guilabel}`Password`.
4. Select {guilabel}`Login`.

Congratulations! You've set up your Funkwhale account. Check out what you can do now in our user documentation.
