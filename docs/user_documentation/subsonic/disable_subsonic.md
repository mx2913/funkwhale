# Disable Subsonic access

If you don't want to use Subsonic any more, you can disable access. This stops any Subsonic apps being able to log in to your account. To do this:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select the cog icon ({fa}`cog`) or your avatar to expand the user menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Settings`.
4. Scroll to the {guilabel}`Subsonic API password` section.
5. Select {guilabel}`Disable Subsonic access`.
6. Select {guilabel}`Disable access` in the warning message that appears.
7. The Subsonic password field shows {guilabel}`Access disabled`.

```

```{tabbed} Mobile

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select the cog icon ({fa}`cog`) or your avatar to open the {guilabel}`Options` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Settings`.
4. Scroll to the {guilabel}`Subsonic API password` section.
5. Select {guilabel}`Disable Subsonic access`.
6. Select {guilabel}`Disable access` in the warning message that appears.
7. The Subsonic password field shows {guilabel}`Access disabled`.

```

You're done! Subsonic apps can no longer access your account. You can re-enable the API at any time by [requesting a new password](subsonic_password).
