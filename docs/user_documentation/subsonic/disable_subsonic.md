# Disable Subsonic access

If you don't want to use Subsonic any more, you can disable access. This stops any Subsonic apps being able to log in to your account. To do this:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select your profile picture to expand the user menu.
3. Select __Settings__.
4. Scroll to the __Subsonic API password__ section.
5. Select __Disable Subsonic access__.
6. Select __Disable access__ in the warning message that appears.
7. The Subsonic password field shows __Access disabled__.

You're done! Subsonic apps can no longer access your account. You can re-enable the API at any time by [requesting a new password](subsonic_password).
