# Follow a library

Follow a library to get access to its content. There are two ways to follow a library:

```{contents}
:local:
```

## Use a sharing link

If you've received a sharing link, you can use this to follow a library. To do this:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select the upload icon ({fa}`upload`) in the top of the sidebar.
3. Select {guilabel}`Get started` under {guilabel}`Follow remote libraries`. A screen appears showing you the libraries you are following.
4. Paste the sharing link into the {guilabel}`Search a remote library` search bar.
5. Select the {guilabel}`Search` icon or hit {kbd}`⏎ Return` to search for the library. If the library exists, a library card appears.
6. Select {guilabel}`Follow` on the library card. If the library's privacy level is {guilabel}`Nobody except me`, the owner needs to approve the request.

```

```{tabbed} Mobile

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select the upload icon ({fa}`upload`) at the top of the screen
3. Select {guilabel}`Get started` under {guilabel}`Follow remote libraries`. A screen appears showing you the libraries you are following.
4. Paste the sharing link into the {guilabel}`Search a remote library` search bar.
5. Select the {guilabel}`Search` icon or hit {kbd}`⏎ Return` to search for the library. If the library exists, a library card appears.
6. Select {guilabel}`Follow` on the library card. If the library's privacy level is {guilabel}`Nobody except me`, the owner needs to approve the request.

```

That's it! The server then scans the content and you can see it on your {term}`pod`.

## Follow from content on your pod

```{note}
You can only follow a library from content pages if its privacy level is not {guilabel}`Nobody except me`.
```

If a user on your {term}`pod` has already followed a library, you can find it by selecting content from that library. To do this:

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select a track, album, or artist from the library you want to follow.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page. The library card appears in the {guilabel}`User libraries` section.
4. Select {guilabel}`Follow` on the library card.

You're done! The content will remain on the server even if the other user stops following the library.
