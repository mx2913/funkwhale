# Share a library

Sharing a library gives another user access to the library's content. When a user follows your library, they'll be able to play and download any content it contains. Share private libraries with friends and family or share public libraries with everyone!

To share a library you own:

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select the upload icon (â‡§) in the top of the sidebar.
3. Select __Get started__ under __Upload third-party content in a library__.
4. A screen appears showing your upload quota and your libraries.
5. Select __Library Details__ under the library you want to share.
6. The __Sharing link__ appears on the library details page. Select __Copy__ to copy the sharing link to your clipboard. A label appears letting you know you've copied the link.
7. Send the link to whomever you want to share the library with.

If you have set the library's privacy level to __Nobody except me__, you need to approve followers. You receive a notification when a user follows your library. To approve a follow request:

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select your profile picture to expand the user menu.
3. Select __Notifications__. The notifications screen opens.
4. Notifications show the username of the user who wants to follow the library as well as the library name. Select __Accept__ to approve the follow request or __Reject__ to reject the request.

That's it! You've shared your library. The invited users can now listen to its content.
