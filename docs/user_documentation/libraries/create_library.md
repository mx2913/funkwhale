# Create a library

```{tip}
Want to publish your own content on your pod? Take a look at channels.
```

To start uploading your collection to your pod, you need to create a library. You can create as many libraries as you need.

To create a library:

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select the upload icon (⇧) in the top of the sidebar.
3. Select __Get started__ under __Upload third-party content in a library__.
4. A screen appears showing your upload quota. If you have created any libraries, these are also shown.
5. Select __Create a new library__.
6. Enter a __Name__ for your library (required).
7. Enter __Description__ for your library.
8. Set the __Visibility__ of your library. This determines who can access the content.
   - __Everyone, across all instances__ – the library's content is available to everybody who interacts with your pod. This includes users of other pods.
   - __Everyone on this instance__ – the library's content is available to all users on your pod. This does not include users of other pods.
   - __Nobody except me__ – the library's content is only available to you and people you share the library with.
9. Select __Create library__.
10. A screen appears showing you a summary of your library.

```{warning}
Select __Nobody except me__ if you don't own the copyright for the content or it isn't freely licensed.
```

Well done! You've created your library. Now you can add some content to it.
