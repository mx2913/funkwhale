# Manage your libraries

A Funkwhale library is a way of organizing audio content you upload to your pod. You can set the privacy level on libraries to control who can access them. Choose from the available privacy levels:

- __Everyone, across all instances__ – the library's content is available to everybody who interacts with your pod. This includes users of other pods.
- __Everyone on this instance__ – the library's content is available to all users on your pod. This does not include users of other pods.
- __Nobody except me__ – the library's content is only available to you and people you share the library with.

Use libraries for private collections or freely licensed music you want to share.
