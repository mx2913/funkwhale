You can change the order of content in your queue at any time. To do this:

1. Select the up arrow ({fa}`caret-up`) on the queue menu to expand the queue.
2. Pick up tracks by selecting the grip lines on the left. Your mouse pointer shows a hand ({fa}`hand-grab-o`).
3. Drop the tracks in their new position in the queue.
4. Select {guilabel}`Close` to close the queue.

That's it! You've rearranged the content in your queue.
