# Change your activity visibility

Your **activity visibility** determines who can see your listening activity on Funkwhale. There are three visibility options:

- **Nobody except me** – only you can see your listening activity.
- **Everyone on this instance** – users who have an account on the same {term}`pod` as you can see your listening activity.
- **Everyone, across all instances** – anybody can see your listening activity.
