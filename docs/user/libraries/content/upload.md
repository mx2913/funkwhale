# Upload content to a library

```{note}
Access to a library's content is set at a __library level__. You can't change the privacy level of content within the library.
```

Once you have [created a library](../create.md), you can start uploading content to it. Funkwhale reads information about your content from its metadata. For the best results, make sure to [tag your files well](tag.md).

To upload content to a library:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Desktop
:sync: desktop

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select the upload icon ({fa}`upload`) in the top of the sidebar.
3. Select {guilabel}`Get started` under {guilabel}`Upload third-party content in a library`.
4. A screen appears showing your upload quota and your libraries.
5. Select {guilabel}`Upload` under the library you want to add content to.
6. Click on the section marked {guilabel}`Click to select files` to open a file picker, or drag and drop your files on to it.
   - If you opened the file picker, select the files you want to upload and confirm.
7. The screen shows you the status of each upload. Once the upload queue is empty, your upload is complete.
