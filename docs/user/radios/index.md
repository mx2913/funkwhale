# Radios

Radios are a great way to discover new music or rediscover old favorites. A radio builds a dynamic playlist of content based on selected criteria. Create genre and artist radios, or tune in to one of Funkwhale's built-in radios.

Funkwhale offers the following radios out of the box:

- **Your content** – listen to content from [libraries](../libraries/index.md) you own.
- **Favorites** – listen to tracks from your [favorites](../favorites/index.md) list.
- **Random** – discover something new by letting Funkwhale choose tracks at random.
- **Recently Added** – listen to the latest content added to your {term}`pod`.
- **Less listened** – check out tracks you've not heard, or things you haven't given as much attention.
