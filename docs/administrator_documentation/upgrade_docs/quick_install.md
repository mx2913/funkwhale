# Upgrade using the quick install script

If you installed Funkwhale using the [quick install script](../installation_docs/quick_install), upgrading your instance is as simple as running the following command on your server:

```bash
sudo sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://get.funkwhale.audio/upgrade.sh)".
```

The script runs through the necessary setup instructions.
