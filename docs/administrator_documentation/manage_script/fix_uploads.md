# Fix uploads

Use the `fix_uploads` command to let Funkwhale sort out common issues with your audio files.

## Commands

```{warning}
Running `fix_uploads` with the `--no-dry-run` flag is irreversible. Make sure you [back up your data](../upgrade_docs/backup.md).
```

To ensure you don't change data by accident, this command runs in dry run mode by default. In dry run mode, the command lists the items it will modify. Run the command with the `--no-dry-run` flag to perform the action.

### Fix mimetypes

Check and fix file mimetypes with the `--mimetype` flag. This helps prevent issues with serving music files.

````{tabbed} Debian
