# Purge domain data

```{warning}
Purging a domain's data removes all objects and caches associated to that domain. This impacts users who have objects from these domains in their libraries.
```

When users follow content from another domain that content is visible on your {term}`pod`. If a domain hosts illegal or offensive content you can purge the content associated with it.
