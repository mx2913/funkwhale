# Add a moderation rule

```{warning}
Purging a domain's data removes all objects and caches associated to that domain. This impacts users who have objects from these domains in their libraries.
```

Add moderation rules to domains to control how they can interact with your {term}`pod`. Moderation rules enable you to restrict content from a domain showing on your pod.

To add a moderation rule to a domain:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your {term}`pod`.
2. Select the wrench icon ({fa}`wrench`) at the top of the sidebar to open the {guilabel}`Administration` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Moderation`. The {guilabel}`Reports` page opens.
4. Select {guilabel}`Domains` at the top of the page. The {guilabel}`Domains` page opens. You can see a list of known domains on this page.
5. Select the domain you want to apply the rule to. The domain's moderation page opens.
6. Select {guilabel}`Add a moderation policy`. The moderation policy form appears.
7. Enter the {guilabel}`Reason` you are applying the rule. Depending on your pod's configuration, users may be able to see this.
8. Choose your moderation rule:
   - {guilabel}`Block everything` – purge all content from the domain and block all content.
   - {guilabel}`Reject media` – only reject media files such as audio files, avatars, and album art.
9. Select {guilabel}`Create` to save your rule.

```
