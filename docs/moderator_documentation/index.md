## Handle user reports

One of the most important duties of a moderator is handling reports. If a user finds content that violates your pod's rules or the law, they can report it. Users can also report other users if they have broken the rules of your pod. Follow the guides in the [Reports](reports/index.md) section to learn how to handle these reports.

## Moderate external domains

As {term}`fediverse` software, Funkwhale interacts with other software over federation. Read through the [Moderate external domains](domains/index.md) section to handle content from other servers.

## Moderate external users

You can moderate how external users interact with users on your pod. Check out the [Moderate external users](users/index.md) guides to learn how to manage users from other servers.

## Manage your allow-list

If your pod admin has set up allow-listing, you can add and remove domains from your pod's list. Follow the guides in the [Allow-listing](allow_listing/index.md) section to learn how to handle your allow-list.
