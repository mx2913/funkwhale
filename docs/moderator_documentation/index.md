## Handle user reports

One of the most important duties of a moderator is handling reports. If a user finds content that violates your pod's rules or the law, they can report it. Users can also report other users if they have broken the rules of your pod. Follow the guides in the [Reports](reports/index.md) section to learn how to handle these reports.
