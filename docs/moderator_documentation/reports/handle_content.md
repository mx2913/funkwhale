# Handle reported content

```{warning}
Deleting reported objects is irreversible. This action deletes the associated files from the pod.
```

You can handle content reports from the {guilabel}`Reports` page or from the reported object's moderation page. You only need to open the moderation page to edit objects.

```{contents}
:local:
```

## Handle reports from the Reports page

1. Log in to your {term}`pod`.
2. Select the wrench icon ({fa}`wrench`) at the top of the sidebar to open the {guilabel}`Administration` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Moderation`. The {guilabel}`Reports` page opens.
4. [Search for the report](search_reports.md).
5. Select an action from the {guilabel}`Actions` section:
   -  {guilabel}`Resolve` – resolve the report with no further action.
   -  {guilabel}`Delete reported object` – delete the object associated with the report. If you delete an artist or album, this deletes all files associated with the object.
