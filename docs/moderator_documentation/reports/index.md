# Handle reports

As a Funkwhale moderator, you have extra permissions. These permissions enable you to handle reports submitted by users and anonymous browsers.

When a user submits a report it ends up in the moderation queue on the {guilabel}`Reports` page. Moderators can use the tools on this page to handle the report.

Each report contains information that can help you handle the reported object:

- The user who submitted the report.
- The report {guilabel}`Category`. You can change this if it is not correct.
- The date the user submitted the report.
- The message the user posted with the report (if applicable).
- The {guilabel}`Status` of the report.
- Any {guilabel}`Internal notes` left by moderators.
- A summary of the {guilabel}`Reported object`.
- A list of available {guilabel}`Actions`.

Follow the guides in this section to start handling reports submitted to your {term}`pod`.
