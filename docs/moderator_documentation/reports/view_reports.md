# View unresolved reports

When a user reports an object on your {term}`pod`, the report gets sent to a moderation queue. You can check this moderation queue to handle any reports that users have submitted.

## Check the Reports page

You can see a list of unresolved reports by going to the {guilabel}`Reports` page. To do this:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your {term}`pod`.
2. Select the wrench icon ({fa}`wrench`) at the top of the sidebar to open the {guilabel}`Administration` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Moderation`. The {guilabel}`Reports` page opens.

```

```{tabbed} Mobile

1. Log in to your {term}`pod`.
2. Select the wrench icon ({fa}`wrench`) at the top of the screen to open the {guilabel}`Administration` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Moderation`. The {guilabel}`Reports` page opens.

```

That's it! A list of unresolved reports appears on the screen. The summary contains the following information:

- The user who submitted the report.
- The report {guilabel}`Category`.
- The date the user submitted the report.
- The message the user posted with the report (if applicable).
- The {guilabel}`Status` of the report.
- Any {guilabel}`Internal notes` left by moderators.
- A summary of the {guilabel}`Reported object`.
- A list of available {guilabel}`Actions`.

Use the tools on this page the handle the reported [content](handle_content.md) or [user](handle_users.md).
