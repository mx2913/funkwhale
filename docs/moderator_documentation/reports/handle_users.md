# Handle reported users

If a user has reported another user on your pod, you need to open the reported user's moderation page. To do this:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your {term}`pod`.
2. Select the wrench icon ({fa}`wrench`) at the top of the sidebar to open the {guilabel}`Administration` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Moderation`. The {guilabel}`Reports` page opens.
4. [Search for the report](search_reports.md) and select {guilabel}`Open in moderation interface` under {guilabel}`Reported object`. The user's moderation page opens.

```

```{tabbed} Mobile

1. Log in to your {term}`pod`.
2. Select the wrench icon ({fa}`wrench`) at the top of the page to open the {guilabel}`Administration` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Moderation`. The {guilabel}`Reports` page opens.
4. [Search for the report](search_reports.md) and select {guilabel}`Open in moderation interface` under {guilabel}`Reported object`. The user's moderation page opens.

```

You can change the following settings in the moderation interface:

- {guilabel}`Login status` – disable this switch to prevent the user being able to log in.
- {guilabel}`Permissions` – add or remove permissions associated with the user.
- {guilabel}`Upload quota` – change the amount of data (in megabytes) that the user can upload.

Once you have made your changes, return to the {guilabel}`Reports` page and {guilabel}`Resolve` the report. Resolving the report assigns it to you so other moderators know who handled the report. Add [internal notes](internal_notes.md) to keep a record of your changes.
